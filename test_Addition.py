Scenario 1: Validating the addition of two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_positive_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correctness of the addition operation when two positive integers are provided as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no setup required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the addition function, passing in two positive integers.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the sum of the two integers and it will be checked by comparing with the known sum.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles the basic use case of adding two positive integers. The expected result is directly connected to the function's specification of returning the sum of the two input numbers.

Scenario 2: Validating the addition of two negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_negative_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correctness of the addition operation when two negative integers are provided as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no setup required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the addition function, passing in two negative integers.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the sum of the two negative integers and it will be checked by comparing with the known sum.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles the case of adding two negative integers. The expected result is directly connected to the function's specification of returning the sum of the two input numbers.

Scenario 3: Validating the addition of a positive and a negative integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_positive_negative_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correctness of the addition operation when a positive and a negative integer are provided as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no setup required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the addition function, passing in a positive and a negative integer.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the sum of the positive and negative integers and it will be checked by comparing with the known sum.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles the case of adding a positive and a negative integer. The expected result is directly connected to the function's specification of returning the sum of the two input numbers.

Scenario 4: Validating the addition of two floating-point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_floating_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correctness of the addition operation when two floating-point numbers are provided as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no setup required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the addition function, passing in two floating-point numbers.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the sum of the two floating-point numbers and it will be checked by comparing with the known sum.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles the case of adding two floating-point numbers. The expected result is directly connected to the function's specification of returning the sum of the two input numbers.
